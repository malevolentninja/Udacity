# Lesson Two: Data Types & Variables

### 1. Numbers 

* Expressions 
Determine what each expression evaluates to using the console:
```sh
2 + 10 - 19 + 4 - 90 + 1 = -92

-20 + -19 - (-10) - (-1) + 24 = -4

(10/5) * 4 - 20 = -12

4096 % 12 = 4
```

* Comparing Numbers 

Determine what each expression evaluates to using the console:
```sh
43 > 47 = false

12 == 17 = false

3 <= 3 = true

1 != 0 = true
```

### 2. Comments

```sh
// single line comment 

/*
multiple
line comment
*/
```

### 3. Quiz: First expression(2-1)

* Write an expression that uses at least 3 different arithmetic operators
* The expression should equal 42.

console.log(7 * 3 + 23 - 2);


### Strings 
' ' are preferred to define literals over " ".

* String concatentation

What's the result with "hello" + "world"?:

```sh
"helloworld" // there was no space added into either string
// "hello" + " world" = "hello world"
```


What do you think will happen when you type "Hello + 5*10"?:

```sh
"Hello + 5*10" // interpreter assumes the whole object is a string
```

What do you think will happen when you type "Hello" + 5*10?

```sh
"Hello50" // implicit type coercion - multiplies number and puts it into a string
```
