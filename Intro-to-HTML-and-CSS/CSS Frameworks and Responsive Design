1. Grid based design 

Title, Image then headline. 
Grid based line. 
Main column on the left then large column into smaller grids. 

New york times do the same thing. 

2. Building a framework 
"CSS frameworks are pre-prepared software frameworks that are meant to allow for easier, 
more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. M
ost of these frameworks contain at least a grid." Wikipedia CSS

Best practice: build css classes for easy layout implementation. 

3. Responsive Web Pages

Increase phone or tablet usage which uses different size screens to view (resolution of thes creen pixels). 
Avg screens 1920px, prev 1024px. 
max width 960px can center to still look good and ensure the content will remain regardless of the size
Responsive changes the size regardless of the device. 
Tablets and phones, use thumbs not mouse consider layout in response. 

E.g. Redit homepage. 
resize and the screen is smaller as the browser size reduces. 

4. Defining the layout

element class="side" is the sidebar
300px = 24% of the screen size. percentage to define 
grid system for two or three systems. 
12 grid columns is max. 
Need to ensure you would be able to have evenly spaced columns, 
in this case 2, 3 and 4 can evenly divide into. 

5. Creating the project

Need .row fo 100% page width 
columns of 1/12-12/12 page width = create content in columns in as much or as little needed. 
1/12 is = 8.33% 
2/12 = 16.66%
12/12 = 100%


6. Framework Version 01

Name for entire row 
.row

coloumn s
col-1 
col-2 (2 columns wide)
col-3
col-12 (full width of row)

7. Negative space

Used to create space for text and images. Layout easier to read. 
Padding on inside and margins are for the outside. 
e.g padding: 10px; will be inside  area whereas margin: 10px;will be outside
margin pushes elements away from eachother. 
Can add sides to be specific e.g. top, bottom , left or right. 

8. Overflow

let text flow

overflow:auto;


9. Media Queries

change css properties depending on device :size, screen and colour.
@media  is the query start 
@media only  screen refers to the screen change.

@media only screen and (max-width: 300px) {

    p {
        background-color:blue;
    }
}

This says only change when the max-width is 300px.
if these two conditions apply then change the paragraph background colour to blue. 

Make paragraphs disappear if the pixels are smaller than 500px:

@media only screen and (max-width: 500px) {
  p {
      display: none;
     }
 }
 
 
 
 10. CSS resetting
 
 Need to ensure regardless of brower or operating systems. 
 normalise.css ensures styles interpreted across the setting. 
 link to normalise.css stylesheet then it will work across browsers. 
 
11. Problems 

Encountering problems which have most likely been done before e.g. stack overflow. 

12. Semantic structure 

once figured structure look at semantic tags , h1, h2 , h3, images and forms 

Ask if any text needs to stand out. 

red top box names  need <h1>

organiseing projects 'featured work' = <h2>


smaller ones = <h3> tags. 


13. Turning the page. 

Make placholder images for the size. 
placehold.it have dimensions pre done. 


14. Continuous improvements 

Once you have the layout done it is important to find fonts and colours which are closest to the design. 


15. Code Test, Refine, Repeat

Look for layout 
customise
