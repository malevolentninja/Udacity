Avg screens 1920px, prev 1024px. 
max width 960px can center to still look good and ensure the content will remain regardless of the size
Responsive changes the size regardless of the device. 
Tablets and phones, use thumbs not mouse consider layout in response. 

E.g. Redit homepage. 
resize and the screen is smaller as the browser size reduces. 

4. Defining the layout

element class="side" is the sidebar
300px = 24% of the screen size. percentage to define 
grid system for two or three systems. 
12 grid columns is max.

in this case 2, 3 and 4 can evenly divide into.

columns of 1/12-12/12 page width = create content in columns in as much or as little needed.
